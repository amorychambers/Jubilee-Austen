                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I'm based in sunny South Wales, where I started my career in coding in between working and
                        cooking
                        for my family. My enthusiasm for coding began when I decided to create a personalised Choose
                        Your
                        Own Adventure story for a dear friend using Twine, and found that learning
                        how to make all the different elements and choices tailor the story was immensely satisfying.
                        After
                        the story was complete, I found myself itching to fill my time with that same intricate, precise
                        logic that coding demands.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>In lieu of a sequel, I dived into front-end development, where I now work with passion and
                        flexibility. In development I have found a career where I can work hard and enthusiastically,
                        making good use of my logical mindset, communication skills, and keen eye for details. Let's
                        share the satisfaction of writing clean, elegant code that achieves the desired outcome
                        reliably, and achieves beautiful results.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean
                        and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
